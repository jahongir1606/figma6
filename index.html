            <p class="writing">Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we are unsure about how to
                <br> get the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design wanted to build a Figma

                copies <br> cataloged and categorized with a voice and tone variation ranging from plain, casual to
                playful. The <br> intention to build this Figma plugin originated from our Medium blog post, ‘Designing
                voice and tone for <br> error messages.
